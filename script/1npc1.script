message("Hey there! I'm sorry, but there isn't much to see here, yet. We're surrounded by bushes and can't get out. It's pretty bad. You see, I'd like to just sit back and do nothing, but I have to talk to you, because I'm the guy who is responsible to show that the message box you're looking at right now is working properly, even with long texts like this one. Pretty cool, huh? I know. Alright then, I see you later. Maybe then one of these bushes will be gone.")
